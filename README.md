# DNDJournal â€” Backend

This is the backend part of my project. As a D&D player and a newly started DM I had trouble saving all data about campaigns, and this project was created to help with that.

## Overview
DNDJournal stores and manages campaign data: campaigns, sessions, characters, NPCs, notes, assets, and related metadata. It exposes a RESTful API used by frontend clients or tools to create, read, update and delete campaign-related data.

## Key Features
- Campaign management (create, update, archive).
- Session logs and timelines.
- Character and NPC CRUD.
- Notes and attachments (assets).
- Simple authentication for API access.
- Migrations and tests included.

## Tech stack
- PHP 8.x
- Laravel (backend framework)
- MySQL / MariaDB (or other supported DB)
- Composer for dependencies
